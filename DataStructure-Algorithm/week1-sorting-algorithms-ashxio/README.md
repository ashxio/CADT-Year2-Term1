# Homework: Sorting Numbers with Arrays

## Objectives

- Understand how sorting algorithms work.
- Implement sorting with both arrays and linked lists.
- Compare the performance and difficulty of each.


## Part A. Study Task (Sorting Algorithm Review)

1. Choose one sorting algorithm from the list:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Etc.

2. In your own words, write a short explanation:
    - How the algorithm works step by step.
    - Its time complexity in Best, Worst, and Average cases.
    - A simple example with 5 numbers (show each pass).

Write your answer in [part_a.txt](part_a.txt) file.

## Part B. Coding With Array
Implement the chosen sorting algorithm using an array.

- Input: `n` integers.
- Output: sorted array in ascending order.

Complete your the code at [sorting_array.hpp](sorting_array.hpp).

Test your implemented sorting algorithm in [main.cpp](main.cpp) to verify.

# Happy Coding!
